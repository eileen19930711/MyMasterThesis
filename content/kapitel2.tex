\section{Geometric Properties of Aerial Photographs}
\label{sec:2.2.Geometry}

This section describes the geometric model of the projection of 3D points into the image generated by a real camera. We first restrict the discussion in subsection~\ref{subsec:2.2.1.Collinearity} to central perspective projection where the collinearity equation originate from. We then model deviations from this model, addressing real cameras with imperfect lenses, in subsection~\ref{subsec:2.2.2.LensDistortion}.

\subsection{Collinearity Equation}
\label{subsec:2.2.1.Collinearity}
We assume frame photography, i.e. photographs exposed in one instant, and assume central projection model, i.e. cameras who have a single viewpoint and a planar sensor and being straight line-preserving.

Collinearity indicates the condition that the image point (on the sensor plate of the camera), the observed point (on the object) and the projection center of the camera were aligned at the moment the picture was taken. Every measured point leads to two collinearity equations, describing transformations from object space to image coordinates:
\begin{equation} %\label{eq:2.3}
\begin{split}
x - x_0 = -c \dfrac {R_{11}(X-X_0) + R_{21}(Y-Y_0) + R_{31}(Z-Z_0)} {R_{13}(X-X_0) + R_{23}(Y-Y_0) + R_{33}(Z-Z_0)} \\
y - y_0 = -c \dfrac {R_{12}(X-X_0) + R_{22}(Y-Y_0) + R_{32}(Z-Z_0)} {R_{13}(X-X_0) + R_{23}(Y-Y_0) + R_{33}(Z-Z_0)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where\newline

$(x, y)$: image coordinates of the point \newline
$(x_0, y_0)$: image coordinates of principal point \newline
$c$: principal distance \newline
$(X, Y, Z)$: object coordinates of the point \newline
$(X_0, Y_0, Z_0)$: object coordinates of projection center \newline
$R_{11},...,R_{33}$: elements of the rotation matrix R (orthogonal 3$\times$3-matrix from object space to image space, with 3 independent angles $\omega$, $\phi$ and $\kappa$)\newline

The exterior orientations: $X_0$, $Y_0$, $Z_0$, $\omega$, $\phi$, $\kappa$ as well as the interior orientations: $x_0$, $y_0$, $c$ are the bundle-adjusted, known elements in this work.
%The image coordinates $x,y$ are the measurements.

\subsection{Lens Distortion Correction}
\label{subsec:2.2.2.LensDistortion}

Regarding the fact that real cameras generally only approximate the perspective camera model, the collinearity model can be expanded to include parameters of lens distortion. Lens distortion correction attempts to correct the position of image features such that they obey the perspective model with sufficient accuracy.[W. FÃ¶rstner et al. 2016] 

Assuming $x$ and $y$ to be the distorted image coordinates, the corrections $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ are then calculated by the following equations
\begin{equation} %\label{eq:2.2}
\begin{split}
\Delta x &= x_p + A_1x_*(r^2-R_0^2) + A_2x_*(r^4-R_0^4) + B_1(r^2+2x_*^2) + B_22x_*y+C_2y \\
\Delta y &= y_p + A_1y  (r^2-R_0^2) + A_2y  (r^4-R_0^4) + B_1(r^2+2y^2)   + B_22x_*y
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $r=\sqrt{x_*^2+y^2}$ and $x_*=\dfrac{x}{C_1}$. The undistorted image coordinates $x\prime$ and $y\prime$ are then calculated by $x\prime=x+\Delta x$ and $y\prime=y+\Delta y$. [F. Kurz et al. 2012] 

%This allows us to reconstruct the viewing rays from the corresponding set of image points.

\section{Line Fitting}
\label{sec:2.3.LineFitting}

Line fitting is the process of constructing a infinite straight line that has the best fit to a 2D dataset. One of the approaches is linear regression, which attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. In the following subsections we derive the model to fit the observed data, the extracted lines from section~\ref{sec:2.1.LineExtraction} in forms of sets of points, in image space by line equation in two-point form.

\subsection{Linear Regression}
\label{subsec:2.3.1}
Given a data set $\{x_i,y_i\}^n_{i=1}$ of $n$ points on a 2D plane, a linear regression model assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable $y_i$ and the regressors $x_i$ is linear. This relationship is modeled through a error variable $e_{y_i}$ -an unobserved random variable that adds noise to the linear relationship between the dependent variable and regressors.
Thus the model takes the form:
\begin{equation} %\label{eq:2.1}
y_i - e_{y_i} = a_0 + a_1x_i
\end{equation}
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Assumptions

\subsection{The Mix Model (Gauss-Helmert Model)}
\label{subsec:2.3.2}

In the case with inconsistencies $e_{x_i}$ and $e_{y_i}$ in both observations $x_i$ and $y_i$, the model takes the form:
\begin{equation} %\label{eq:2.2}
\begin{split}
y_i - e_{y_i} &= a_0 + a_1(x_i-e_{x_i}) = a_0 + a_1\bar{x_i}\\
x_i-e_{x_i} &= \bar{x_i}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
It is known as the mixed model or Gauss-Helmert model.

Line Equation in two-point form:
\begin{equation} %\label{eq:2.4}
y-y_1 = \dfrac{(y_2-y_1)}{(x_2-x_1)}\times(x-x_1)
\end{equation}
where two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ define the infinite line with $x_2\neq x_1$ and $(x,y)$ is any point on the line.





\begin{equation} %\label{eq:2.3}
y = \dfrac{(y_2-y_1)}{(x_2-x_1)}\times x+(y_1-\dfrac{(y_2-y_1)}{(x_2-x_1)}\times x_1)
\end{equation}



In this work, orthogonal regression model is presented based on line equation of two-point form.

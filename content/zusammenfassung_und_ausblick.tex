\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}

This thesis exploits the use of linear regression in image space with combination of collinearity condition for 3D lane markings reconstruction. Without utilization of the neighboring textures, the approach requires initial approximate 3D lines and is highly dependent on quality of pre-known image orientations. Nevertheless, it is robust to partial occlusion and is applicable on the (quasi-)infinite lines as well in cases of lowly textured neighborings. 
%The approach is developed for both dashed and continuous lane lines.???

From simulated experiments in \cref{sec:simulation}, some conclusions are given:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Given approximations with 2 meters bias in Z-direction and sub-pixel random noises in the image coordinates of the detected/measured 2D lines, the 3D positions of line segments were correctly refined.
	
	\item With the same line orientations in 3D space, the configuration strength increases with the increase of amount of covering images from different views.
	
	\item The reconstructed line segments have higher precision in vertical direction than in horizontal direction.
\end{itemize}


From experimental results from true data in \cref{sec:simulation}, some conclusions are given:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The reconstructed line segments are significantly far from DSM. This fact responds to the necessity of reconstrucion based on detected 2D lines in image space and the viewing geometry, instead of simply applying mean filter or such to denoise the DSM.....
	
	\item  configuration strength increases with the amount of covering images from different views.
	\item The reconstructed line segments have higher precision in vertical direction than in horizontal direction.
\end{itemize}

using precisely detected lines with sub-pixel precision as well the bundle adjusted image orientations, the lane markings can be reconstructed with ???centimeter accuracy??? using well configured aerial images.


%\cref{sec:Geometry}
With the extracted line in the form of sets of points with sub-pixel accuracy and EOIO accuracy???, linear regression can be applied on reconstructing the 3D line segment position.

image distortion vs straight line approximation


image configuration plays an important roll in 3D reconstruction. Being covered from more views



For SGM generated DSM, lane markings can be exploited to provide information for DSM refinement. 

lane markings are one of the most valuable features on road surface reconstruction to provide 

 refinement based on triangulation is necessary.



Influence of 


advantage

The approach can be used on lane markings reconstruction

not relying on textures or appearance-based matching
but purely based on imaging geometry.

drawback

unknown point-to-point relationship in image space

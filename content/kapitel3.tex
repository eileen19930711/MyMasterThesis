\paragraph{Aerial Images}
For real-time mapping applications during disasters, mass events and traffic monitoring scenarios, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has developed a new optical sensor system-- the 4k system-- on a helicopter from DLR. The oblique aerial images used in this work are acquired from a Canon EOS 1D-X camera, one of the three non-metric cameras in the 4k system, with an oblique viewing angle $\tau$ of 15$\degree$. The pixel size is around $6.9$ \textmu m and the flying height $H_{flight}$ was around 500 m above ground, which leads to a GSD of $\sim$6.9 cm.

As described in \cite{Fischer2017}, this aerial imagery shall be improved to have an absolute geolocation accuracy of better than 30 centimeters if TerraSAR-X geodetic points are included as reference points.

An example aerial image is shown in \cref{fig:OriImg}. \cref{tab:CameraProperties} lists the properties of this camera, and \cref{tab:SensorViewingGeometry} provides the viewing geometry information.

The images used in this work are acquired with a special flight configuration at both sides of the motorway which guarantees a continuous stereo view perpendicular to the lane marking direction.\footnote{The classical photogrammetric approach on flight planning is to have several straight flight lines which cover the whole motorway in a stereo view. This would be possible in this project yet would require more flight costs and would produce many more images.} This is realized by flying at the right-hand side with respect to flying direction along the motorway, with the left oblique camera looking left-down to the motorway, in both forward and backward trips. The flight configuration is shown in \cref{fig:FlightTrajectory} on the Google Earth platform.

There are 15 images used in this work: 8 images in forward trip (first strip) and 7 in backward (second strip). The striplength is ??? meter. The coverage configuration is shown in fig???.
% data of acquisition, number of images, length of flight strips,…

Besides, the forward overlap is around 70\%, and all the lane markings are covered by both strips, whereas the side overlap depends on the distance of flight strips, which is a result of the pilots navigation ability and other influences, like wind. Nevertheless, the motorway in its entire width was covered by the two flight strips. Altogether, this results in approximately 8-image coverage in road areas. 


\paragraph{Exterior and Interior Orientations}
The aerial images are geo-referenced by \gls{gnss}/Inertial system IGI AEROcontrol-IId and further improved by \gls{sapos} correction. Self-calibrating bundle adjustment is applied to calibrate \gls{io} parameters and to refine \gls{eo} parameters. \cref{tab:EOprecision} and \cref{tab:IOprecision} show the precision of IO and EO parameters after self-calibrating bundle adjustment. % Missing: specification of the system, ,….
To provide an overall quality on the interior orientations: from the calibration result of interior orientations (involving lens distortion), the residuals appear non-systematic and the biggest residual $r_{max, IO}$ is around 1 pixel.% 1 pixel可彙整入表3.4，改正數無系統性如果要寫出來，需繪圖證明。

To evaluate the influence of the uncertainties in exterior and interior parameters on positioning precision in object space, the maximum values for each component based on the flight configuration was calculated.
The quality of interior and exterior orientation parameters set would have a maximum impact in object space for around $16$ [cm] in X,Y-direction:
\begin{itemize}
      \item caused by inaccurate camera position: 
      \item [] $\sqrt{\sigma_{north}^2+\sigma_{east}^2}=\sqrt{0.055^2+0.035^2}\approx0.065$ [meter]
      \item caused by inaccurate camera attitude, as illustrated in :
      \item [] $ H_{flight}\times\sqrt{(\tan(\sigma_{roll}+\tau)-\tan\tau)^2+(\dfrac{\tan\sigma_{pitch}}{\cos\tau})^2}$
      \item [] $=500\times\sqrt{(\tan(0.002\degree+15\degree)-\tan15\degree)^2+(\dfrac{\tan0.002\degree}{\cos15\degree})^2}\approx0.026$ [meter]
      \item caused by inaccurate Interior Orientations:
      \item [] $r_{max, IO}\times GSD=1\times0.069=0.069$ [meter]
\end{itemize}
and around $6.9$ [cm] in Z-direction:
\begin{itemize}
      \item caused by inaccurate camera position:
      \item [] $\sigma_{altitude}\approx0.069$ [meter]
%      \item caused by inaccurate camera attitude:
%      \item [] $H_{flight}\times\dfrac{\tan(\sigma_{roll}+\tau)-\tan\tau}{\tan(\sigma_{roll}+\tau)}$
%      \item [] $=500\times\dfrac{\tan(0.002\degree+15\degree)-\tan15\degree}{\tan(0.002\degree+15\degree)}\approx0.070$ [meter]
%      \item caused by inaccurate Interior Orientations:
%      \item [] $r_{max, IO}\times GSD\times\dfrac{\sin\tau}{\cos\tau}=1\times0.069\times\dfrac{\sin15\degree}{\cos15\degree}\approx0.018$ [meter]

The above information tells the positioning precision in object space with measurements on a single image. With corresponding measurements from MVS, which allows the intersection of multiple projection rays from different directions, the positioning precision is expected to be improved.% for being overdetermined.



\paragraph{\gls{dsm}}
The DSM used in this experiment is generated by SGM based on MVS. As the asphalt road surfaces where the lane markings locate on are poorly textured, the SGM generated DSM is especially noisy in such poorly textured areas. However, such high-resolution DSM gives a good starting point for the lane marking refinement. In other words, the DSM will be used only for setting up the initial values of the work flow, and will not influence the final results of the 3D lane marking reconstruction.

The DSM has 20 cm grid spacing. \cref{fig:DSM} shows a part of the DSM. Standard deviations of the height value in this part of the DSM is shown in \cref{fig:DSMstd}. The number of stereo image pairs used for each part on the DSM is shown in \cref{fig:DSMnumber}.

\end{figure}


\paragraph{Orthorectified Images}
The orthorectified images are processed using the DSM and the interior and exterior orientations derived from the bundle adjustment. They are georeferenced and the scale is uniform. One of the orthorectified images is shown in \cref{fig:OrthoImg}. The orthorectified images are only used for setting up initial values and used as intermediary step for processing the road masks, but do not influence the results of 3D lane marking reconstruction.
% Maybe a nice place, to visualize the DSM error on the lane marking projections…

\paragraph{Road Masks}
Road segments are masked out from original images based on \gls{osm} data: Firstly, the rasterized road segments from OSM data are written with 25 meter buffer width around road axes into orthorectified images. By back-projecting the mask from orthorectified image to original image using the 3D information from the DSM, it can then be used to mask out the road regions on the original images, as shown in \cref{fig:MaskedImg}.

\section{Parameter Selection}
\label{sec:ParameterSelection}

%%% extraction %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In lane marking extraction step, the $\sigma$ value for Gaussian smoothing is set to be 1.8 % From HALCON Referenz: For the choice of the thresholds High and Low one has to keep in mind that the second directional derivative depends on the amplitude and width of the line as well as the choice of Sigma. Thus: you must set this value depending on the lane marking width?
to slightly suppress the noise in images.
The extracted lines whose length is less than 70 pixels are rejected % why
regarding the fact that a dashed lane-line is no longer than 6 meter which is correspondingly 87 pixels with GSD of 6.9 cm.

%%% line projection on DSM %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$\Delta Z < thres$



%%% sliding window %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The length of the sliding window depends on the expected curvature, and for motorways it was fixed to 9m …
% What about dashed lane markings in the middle? Why do you choose 9m -> compromise between robustness and minimized systematic errors.



%%% measurements collection: buffer width %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The 10 pixels buffering width corresponds to 70 cm in object space. the imperfect DSM profile has maximum ...which is around 70 cm in image space. 


%%% LS parameters %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
convergence threshold 


%%% amount of image coverage %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%% lens distortion -> not straight line preserved
as mentioned in sec.3.1, that the overall interior orientations result in sub-pixel accuracy, the extracted lane lines on the original (lens-distorted) images are approximated to be straight line preserved.

\section{Simulation}
\label{sec:simulation}
This section aims to verify the correctness of the derived LS model and to discover some characteristics of the reconstruction model using simulation data. The used materials are as described in \cref{sec:Materials}. Only the measurements (the image coordinates of the extracted lines), the true and approximate values of the unknowns (the object coordinates of a line segment) in the non-linear LS model are simulated, as described in \cref{subsec:simudata}.

\cref{subsec:simuresult} firstly evaluates if the iteration scheme converges to the correct solution given imperfect initial values of the unknowns. The significant height differences between the approximate and the reconstructed line segments are also presented, indicating the refining ability of the proposed reconstruction approach.

The ability of the derived LS model on detecting the measurement errors is then evaluated. Furthermore, how the increase of covering images would influence the reconstruction result is elaborated.

%Note that the quality of camera parameters (EO., IO. and additional parameters) do not have influences in simulation since the simulated measurements are produced with the same set of camera parameters as the set used for 3D reconstruction.




\subsection{Simulation Data}
\label{subsec:simudata}

\paragraph{The true line segment in object space}
Firstly, the object coordinates of the endpoints of a 3D line segment are defined, with 151.8 meters length, locating on the road surface in the test area (German highway A9) with 3 to 7 aerial images coverage. By linear interpolating several points with 0.2 meter spaces (considering DSM grid of 0.2 meter) between the two endpoints, a 3D line segment in the form of a set of 3D points is generated. This 3D line segment serves as the ground truth in the experiments in \cref{sec:simulation}. 

\paragraph{The observed line segments in image spaces}
The observations in the LS model are simulated by back-projecting the true line segment into the covering images. Gaussian random noise $e\sim\mathcal{N}(0,0.5^2)$ is added in the observations for each LS adjustment, as line extraction process is of sub-pixel accuracy. The added noise is plotted in \cref{fig:noise}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Simu_errorhist_1.png}
  \caption{\small The added Gaussian random noise in the observations.}
  \label{fig:noise}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The approximate line segment in object space}
The initial estimates for non-linear LS adjustment is generated by projecting the observed line segments in image space onto the DSM.

\subsection{Simulation Result}
\label{subsec:simuresult}

%%% analysis on the unknowns:
\cref{fig:Simu3D_2} shows the reconstructed and the true line segments in UTM coordinate system (in Zone 32N). The distances from the reconstructed line nodes to the true line segment are computed and collected, resulting in sample size of $18$. The sample mean is $0.008$ [meter] and the sample variance is $0.101^2$ [meter\textsuperscript{2}]. % This sampling procedure is assumed to be independent and random.%??? (t test assumptions)

For such small sample size data, a two-tailed t-test is adopted to test if the population mean significantly not equals zero, i.e. \textbf{if the reconstructed line segments are significantly far from the true line segments}. Null hypothesis ($H_0$) and (two-tailed) alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) are stated as:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
H_0: \mu=0\\
H_A: \mu\neq0
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

A significance level $\alpha=0.05$ is selected, with degree of freedom being $18-1=17$, the two-tailed t-table value $T_{(0.975,17)}$ is
\begin{equation*}
T_{(0.975,17)}=2.110
\end{equation*}
which leads to the decision rule: if test statistic $T_{obs}$ is less than $-T_{(0.975,17)}=-2.110$ or greater than $T_{(0.975,17)}=2.110$, reject the null hypothesis.

With the sample mean $\overline{x}=0.008$ [meter],
the proposed population mean $\mu_0=0$ [meter],
the sample standard deviation $\sigma=0.101$ [meter],
and sample size $n=18$, the test statistic for One Sample T Test has the calculated value:
\begin{equation*}
T_{obs} = \frac{\overline{x}-\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{0.008-0}{0.101/\sqrt{18}}\approx0.34
\end{equation*}
which is neither less than $-T_{(0.975,17)}=-2.110$ nor greater than $T_{(0.975,8)}=2.110$, i.e. not in the rejection region. As a result, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, \textbf{we are not able to claim that the reconstructed line is significantly far away from the true line}. This indicates that \textbf{the derived non-linear LS adjustment model for 3D reconstruction is correct}.

\cref{fig:Simu3D_1} shows the reconstructed line segments and the DSM profile which serves as the initial approximation for non-linear LS adjustment, in UTM coordinate system (in Zone 32N). The maximum distance between them is 1.97 meter, mainly in Z-direction. This tells that \textbf{the reconstruction model is at least able to refine the initial approximation with 2 meters bias in Z-direction}.

\clearpage




%The distances from the reconstructed line segment to the DSM profile are plotted into histogram in \cref{fig:SimuHist_1}. They are collected along the reconstructed line segments with 0.2 meter spacing (considering the DSM grid of 0.2 meter), resulting in sample size of $381$. The sample mean is $-0.029$ [meter] and the sample variance is $0.083$ [meter]. % This sampling procedure is assumed to be independent and random.%??? and normal distributed (Z test assumptions)

%In order to know \textbf{if the mean distance from the reconstructed line segments to the DSM profile is significantly non-zero}, a two-tailed Z-test is adopted for such big sample size cases. Null hypothesis ($H_0$) and (two-tailed) alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) are stated as:
%\begin{equation*}
%\begin{split}
%H_0: \mu=0\\
%H_A: \mu\neq0
%\end{split}
%\end{equation*}

%A significance level $\alpha=0.05$ is selected, which is $0.025$ on each tail of the population, i.e. the area in body is $0.975$ out of 100\%. The corresponding z-score is:
%\begin{equation*}
%Z_{0.975}=1.96
%\end{equation*}
%which leads to the decision rule: if $Z_{obs}$ is less than $-1.96$ or greater than $1.96$, reject the null hypothesis.

%With the sample mean $\overline{x}=-0.029$,
%the proposed population mean $\mu_0=0$,
%the sample standard deviation $\sigma=0.083$,
%and sample size $n=381$, the test statistic for a One Sample Z Test has a calculated value:
%\begin{equation*}
%Z_{obs} = \frac{\overline{x}-\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{-0.029-0}{0.083/\sqrt{381}}\approx-6.82
%\end{equation*}

%As the test statistic $Z_{obs}\approx-6.82$ is less than $-Z_{0.975}=-1.96$, i.e. in the rejection region, the null hypothesis is rejected. In other words, \textbf{with 95\% confidence we can claim that the mean distance from the reconstructed line segment to the DSM profile is significantly non-zero}. This phenomenon is as expected, as mentioned in sec:DSM???. 

The presented continuous lane line is 17 times segment-wise reconstructed, where each segment reconstruction is an independent LS adjustment process. \cref{fig:SimuImgNum} gives the information on the amount of covering images, the redundancies and the height value of the reconstructed nodes, of each segment.

\end{figure}

%%% analysis on measurements:
\cref{fig:SimuError} shows the mean and variance of the added random Gaussian noise and the adjusted residuals of each segment. This two samples are compared by applying a two-tailed two-sample T-test. Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) are stated as:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=0\\
H_A: \mu1-\mu_2\neq0
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

With significance level $\alpha=0.05$ and degree of freedom $\approx300$, the t-score is 
\begin{equation*}
T_{0.975,300}=1.968
\end{equation*}

As shown in \cref{fig:SimuTtest}, all the test statistics $T_{obs}$ of each segment are not less than $-T_{0.975,300}=-1.968$ or greater than $T_{0.975,300}=1.968$, i.e. not in the rejection region, the null hypothesis could not be rejected. In other words, we fail to claim that the adjusted residuals are statistically different from the added random noise.

without the influence of imperfect camera parameters,

By assuming a constant priori standard deviation of measurements to $1$ [pixel] in all the LS adjustment processes, the priori variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameters
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\hat{X}\hat{X}}=\sigma_0^2(\mathsf{A^TA})^{-1}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{\hat{X}}^2 && \sigma_{\hat{X}\hat{Y}} && \sigma_{\hat{X}\hat{Z}} \\
\sigma_{\hat{Y}\hat{X}} && \sigma_{\hat{Y}}^2 && \sigma_{\hat{Y}\hat{Z}} \\
\sigma_{\hat{Z}\hat{X}} && \sigma_{\hat{Z}\hat{Y}} && \sigma_{\hat{Z}}^2
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
reflects the quality of the design matrix in different LS adjustment processes. In other words, by assuming same measuring quality of 1 pixel level in each segment, $\Sigma_{\hat{X}\hat{X}}$ reflects the configuration strength of each line segments.


From \cref{fig:SimuSigmaxx} it can be seen that the estimated parameters generally have smaller priori variance values (in horizontal direction) $\sqrt{\sigma_{\hat{X}}^2+\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{Y}}^2}$ and (in vertical direction) $\sigma_{\hat{Z}}$ with the increase of covering images, whereas larger deviations from the trend are contained in vertical direction. \textbf{By increasing the configuration strength, i.e. increasing the amount of covering images with different orientations, the precision of the estimated parameters can be improved}.

Besides, the priori variance of the estimated parameters is smaller in vertical direction $\sigma_{\hat{Z}}$ than in horizontal direction $\sqrt{\sigma_{\hat{X}}^2+\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{Y}}^2}$. This tells that \textbf{the reconstructed nodes have higher precision in vertical direction}. [reason? sec 3.1]

\section{True Data}

\subsection{True Data Result}
\label{subsec:trueresult}

A continuous lane marking of 255.9 meters length is reconstructed. \cref{fig:Test3D} shows the reconstructed line segments and the DSM profile in UTM coordinate system (in Zone 32N). The distances from the reconstructed line segment to the DSM profile are computed and plotted into histogram in \cref{fig:TestHist}. They are collected along the reconstructed line segments with 0.2 meter spacing (considering the DSM grid of 0.2 meter), resulting in sample size of $1256$. The sample mean is $-0.180$ [meter] and the sample standard deviation is $0.174$ [meter]. %This sampling procedure is assumed to be independent and random.%??? and normal distributed (Z test assumptions)

Assuming DSM height profile being significantly lower than the reconstructed line segments for more than $17$??? centimeters, a lower-tailed Z-test is adopted. Null hypothesis ($H_0$) and (one-tailed) alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) are stated as:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
H_0: \mu\geq-0.170\\
H_A: \mu<-0.170
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

A significance level $\alpha=0.05$ is selected, i.e. the area in body is $0.950$ out of 100\%. The corresponding z-score is:
\begin{equation*}
Z_{0.950}=1.64
\end{equation*}
leads to the decision rule: if $Z_{obs}$ is less than $-1.64$, reject the null hypothesis.

With the sample mean $\overline{x}=-0.181$ [meter],
the proposed population mean $\mu_0=-0.170$ [meter],
the sample standard deviation $\sigma=0.174$ [meter],
and sample size $n=1256$, the test statistic for a One Sample Z Test has a calculated value:
\begin{equation*}
Z_{obs} = \frac{\overline{x}-\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{-0.181-(-0.170)}{0.174/\sqrt{1256}}\approx-2.24
\end{equation*}

As the test statistic $Z_{obs}\approx-2.24$ is less than $-Z_{0.95}=-1.64$, i.e. in the rejection region, the null hypothesis is rejected. In other words, \textbf{with 95\% confidence we can claim that the DSM profile is in average, statistically and significantly lower than the reconstructed line segments for at least $\mathbf{17}$ centimeters in this region}. %This phenomenon is as expected, as mentioned in sec:DSM???

\cref{fig:TestImgNum} gives the information on the amount of covering images, the redundancies and the height value of the reconstructed nodes, of each segment. Note that in each segment, LS adjustment is processed independently.

Compare to the simulation data, where all line segments lie on a straight line and have same orientations, the true data (a continuous lane marking) is a curve line, whose line segments have different orientations from each other. Even some segments may have same image coverage configuration, their LS model may have different configuration due to their different orientaions in 3D space. \cref{fig:TestSigmxx} shows that the estimated parameters generally have smaller priori variance values with the increase of covering images. However there are some other factors influencing the configuration strength with same covering image amount.(vermutlich, the configuration strength in image space counts. show figures)

By increasing the configuration strength, the priori precision of the estimated parameters can be improved. \textbf{Not only the increase of the amount of covering images but also the line segment orientations in image space count for the configuration strength}.

%3.1  Reference Data
%The primary reference dataset used in this paper is a 3D point cloud acquired by airborne laser scanning with a density of approximately 0.5 points per square meter.  The laser point cloud data is georeferenced in UTM Zone 31 North, ETRS89 and contains orthometric heights with respect to EGM 2008.  The orthometric  heights  were  converted  to  ellipsoidal  heights  by  simply dding the undulations from EGM 2008.  Only the first pulse returns is used in this study, as the DSM produced by image matching corresponds to the visible surface.  The LIDAR data for the errassa and Vacarisses test areas was acquired on 26th and 27th ovember 2007. The LaMola LIDAR data was acquired on 26th ovember 2007 and 4th May 2008

evaluation procedure
%The distance between the LIDAR points and the generated DSM are computed and evaluated statistically
%To evaluate the influence of the over-counting correction and MGM
%cost aggregation independently, two evaluations were performed


The correctness of the derived model is firstly verified by using simulation data without adding errors in the simulated measurements yet some biases are added in the initial values of the unknowns.

Dashed lane-lines reconstruction is presented in \cref{sec:td-short}. % 5 set of dashed lane line data
% show the differences with DSM profile

In long lane-lines reconstruction cases

%3.1  Reference Data
%The primary reference dataset used in this paper is a 3D point cloud acquired by airborne laser scanning with a density of approximately 0.5 points per square meter.  The laser point cloud data is georeferenced in UTM Zone 31 North, ETRS89 and contains orthometric heights with respect to EGM 2008.  The orthometric  heights  were  converted  to  ellipsoidal  heights  by  simply dding the undulations from EGM 2008.  Only the first pulse returns is used in this study, as the DSM produced by image matching corresponds to the visible surface.  The LIDAR data for the errassa and Vacarisses test areas was acquired on 26th and 27th ovember 2007. The LaMola LIDAR data was acquired on 26th ovember 2007 and 4th May 2008

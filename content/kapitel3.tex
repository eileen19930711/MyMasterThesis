\chapter{Experimental Results and Evaluations}
\label{chap:k3}

evaluation procedure
The distance between the LIDAR points and the generated DSM are computed and evaluated statistically
To evaluate the influence of the over-counting correction and MGM
cost aggregation independently, two evaluations were performed

3.1  Reference Data
%The primary reference dataset used in this paper is a 3D point cloud acquired by airborne laser scanning with a density of approximately 0.5 points per square meter.  The laser point cloud data is georeferenced in UTM Zone 31 North, ETRS89 and contains orthometric heights with respect to EGM 2008.  The orthometric  heights  were  converted  to  ellipsoidal  heights  by  simply dding the undulations from EGM 2008.  Only the first pulse returns is used in this study, as the DSM produced by image matching corresponds to the visible surface.  The LIDAR data for the errassa and Vacarisses test areas was acquired on 26th and 27th ovember 2007. The LaMola LIDAR data was acquired on 26th ovember 2007 and 4th May 2008
